# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict customer churn in the banking sector. By leveraging a dataset from a popular data science platform, we develop classification models to identify customers at risk of leaving the bank. This predictive capability allows for proactive retention strategies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and the bank's bottom line.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- Model performance comparison and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Actionable insights for customer retention

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing tools
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model development
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following key features:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Account information (balance, product types held)
- Transaction history
- Customer interactions with the bank
- Churn status (target variable)

## Model Development

We implement and compare several classification algorithms, including:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. XGboost Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. K-Nearest Neighboor (KNN)

Each model is tuned using cross-validation and grid search for optimal hyperparameters.

## Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated based on:

- Recall
- ROC AUC score

## Feature Importance

We analyze feature importance to identify the key factors influencing customer churn. This information is crucial for developing targeted retention strategies.

## Results and Insights

(This section would be filled with actual results after running the models)

Key findings from our analysis include:
- Top predictors of customer churn
- Customer segments most at risk
- Recommended actions for reducing churn rate

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks)
- Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., customer service interactions)
- Develop a real-time churn prediction system
