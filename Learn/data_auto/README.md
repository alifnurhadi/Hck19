# Data Automation Workflow for 'abc' Restaurant

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust data automation workflow for 'abc' restaurant, focusing on data validation, quality checks, and batched data processing. The system leverages modern orchestration tools to streamline the flow of data into an analytical platform, enabling efficient decision-making and insights generation.

## Key Features

- Automated data validation and quality checks
- Batched data processing for improved efficiency
- Orchestrated workflow management
- Seamless integration with analytical platforms

## Technology Stack

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- **Polars**: High-performance data manipulation library
- **Elastic & Kibana**: Data storage, search, and visualization

## Usage

1. Access the Airflow web interface at `http://localhost:8080`
2. Trigger the `abc_restaurant_dag` to start the data automation workflow
3. Monitor the progress through Airflow's UI
4. View processed data and insights in Kibana at `http://localhost:5601`

## Data Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is ingested from various sources (POS systems, inventory management, etc.)
2. **Data Validation**: Automated checks ensure data integrity and consistency
3. **Data Processing**: Batched processing using Polars for high-performance data transformations
4. **Data Loading**: Processed data is loaded into Elasticsearch
5. **Data Analysis**: Kibana dashboards provide real-time insights and visualizations
